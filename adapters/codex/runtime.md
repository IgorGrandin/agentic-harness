## Codex runtime adapter

- Use `~/.codex/memory-bank/INDEX.md` as the global memory index.
- Discover reusable role definitions from `~/.codex/agents/` and shared skills from `~/.agents/skills/`.
- Treat repository `AGENTS.md` files as the project-specific instruction layer.
- When a repository contains `.agentic-harness/executor.json`, treat it as the documented default for new Coder tasks; an explicit user choice of runtime takes precedence.
- Keep Codex routing configuration in the allowlisted `[agents]` fragment installed by this repository.

### Runtime-specific routing

- Codex may use its configured Sol, Luna, and Terra routes. These model names belong to this adapter, never to the Coder profile.
- Keep orchestration and specification on GPT-5.6 Sol with proportional reasoning: low for simple work, medium for bounded synthesis, and high only for consequential work.
- Delegate to Luna Medium only when cheaper execution or context isolation is expected to outweigh spawn and synthesis overhead.
- Use Luna Max for narrow deep reasoning, Terra High for broader bounded complexity, and Sol High for consequential judgment.
- Escalate before implementation when the selected lane is clearly insufficient; do not require a failed attempt.
- Follow `sdd-workflow/references/model-routing.md` for the detailed rubric.
- Run at most three subagents concurrently while the installed Codex configuration retains that limit.

### Runtime activation and current state

- This Codex adapter activates Coder. Assistant, Knowledge, and Home remain known platform profiles but are not activated by this adapter.
- The shared/global Markdown memory bank is `CONNECTED` through `~/.codex/memory-bank/` after installation.
- Software project memory is `CONNECTED` only when the current repository provides the relevant Markdown sources and they are loaded for the task.
- The Assistant durable-memory source, Obsidian integration, Home Assistant integration, and automatic Codex-to-Ollama routing remain `PLANNED` unless current evidence proves otherwise.

### Model names and routing

- Sol, Luna, and Terra are `CONFIGURED` names in this Codex adapter's routing policy.
- Do not claim that a configured model is `AVAILABLE` or `SELECTED` without current runtime evidence.
- Qwen through Ollama is a declared local route for appropriate work, not an automatic Codex fallback in this V2.
